# FussionCord App — ふゅっしょんこーど あぷり ✦ uwu

> **A smol, cozy description**: FussionCord App is the ✧heart✧ of our platform, where devs can chat, collab, code, and play — all while staying super productive. Think of it like Discord, but with GitHub-y vibes, Flutter-powered smoothness, and an AI coding buddy hiding inside\~ UwU

## ✦ Smol Description ✦

FussionCord App is the Flutter-powered front-end of the FussionCord ecosystem. It’s the cute lil’ client that will bring our developer-first dream alive — a warm, sleek, and powerful app for Android (first), and then slowly blossoming onto iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. uwu ✧

## README for the App ✦

### ✦ What is the FussionCord App?

The **FussionCord App** is where developers will hang out, write code together, chat in real-time, open repos, review pull requests, and get help from an integrated AI coding partner. It’s essentially the place where productivity meets friendship and creativity! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ\*:･ﾟ✧

---

### ✦ Tech Stack (App Side)

* **Dart + Flutter** → single codebase for Android → iOS → Web → Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **State management** → Riverpod (clean modularity uwu\~).
* **Networking** → dio + grpc-dart to talk with our Golang API.
* **Realtime sync** → Firebase (early stage) then websockets for full speed.
* **Code preview** → highlight libraries + syntax prettiness (because code should sparkle ✧).
* **Local storage** → Hive + shared\_preferences.
* **AI Assistant hooks** → integration endpoints for OpenDevin.

### ✦ Workflow for the App (uwu roadmap)

1. **Step 1: Golang API + Firebase auth** → so our Flutter app has a cute backend to talk to.
2. **Step 2: Flutter App (Android)** → build the first usable mobile client with chat + repo integration.
3. **Step 3: Git integration** → users can browse, commit, and PR directly from the app.
4. **Step 4: Multi-platform expansion** → port Flutter to iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
5. **Step 5: Optimize everything** → super smooth animations, minimal memory footprint, optimized rendering.
6. **Step 6: AI integration (OpenDevin)** → contextual code completions + code reviews.
7. **Step 7: Data collection (with consent)** → improve models and AI suggestions.
8. **Step 8: Open source release** → maybe public beta depending on demand and funding.
9. **Step 9: Documentation** → guides for devs to integrate their bots/apps into the FussionCord App.
10. **Step 10: Extreme security** → full security passes, audits, and privacy focus.
